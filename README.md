<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This repository contains a Telegram bot implemented in Python for IAC
- **GitOps Integration**: The bot facilitates GitOps workflows by providing essential functionalities such as network checks, SSL certificate expiration checks, and message sending directly through Telegram.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: With its ability to perform various tasks based on user commands, the bot enhances Infrastructure as Code (IAC) automation efforts. Users can trigger actions like network checks and SSL certificate validations with simple commands, reducing manual intervention.
- **Secure Communication**: The bot operates securely by requiring only the bot token and administrator user IDs for communication. This makes it suitable for deployment in closed networks or environments with restricted access.
- **Streamlined Operations**: By centralizing monitoring and management tasks within Telegram, the bot simplifies operations for DevOps teams. It provides a convenient interface for executing commands and receiving notifications, improving efficiency and collaboration.
- **Project Deletion**: The bot now supports the deletion of all resources related to a specific project in a Kubernetes namespace. This is done through the `/deleteProject <project_name>` command.
### Deployment Flexibility
- **Server Installation**: The bot can be deployed on a server within a closed subnet, providing flexibility in deployment scenarios.
- **Minimal Configuration**: Only the Telegram bot token and administrator user IDs are required for the bot to function, minimizing setup complexity.
- **Scalability**: As a lightweight Telegram bot, it can be easily scaled up or down based on workload requirements without significant resource overhead.
- **Dashboard Integration**: The bot now includes Flask, enabling the use of a dashboard for managing bot functionalities and monitoring activities.
- **Kubernetes Integration**: The bot can interact with a Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes API. This allows the bot to perform various tasks such as retrieving the list of running pods, checking the status of deployments, and more. Before the bot can interact with your Kubernetes cluster, you need to create a ServiceAccount in Kubernetes. This ServiceAccount will be used by the bot to authenticate with the Kubernetes API.

<!-- Additional Features and Usage-->
### Additional Features
- **Disk Space Check**: Use the `/checkDiskSpace` command to check the disk space usage on the server.
- **CPU Usage Check**: Use the `/checkCPUUsage` command to check the CPU usage on the server.
- **Memory Usage Check**: Use the `/checkMemoryUsage` command to check the memory usage on the server.
- **Project Deletion (only with k8s)**: Use the `/deleteProject <project_name>` command to delete all resources related to a specific project in a Kubernetes namespace.

### Database Information
This project utilizes a NoSQL database for efficient and flexible data storage. NoSQL databases are particularly beneficial for this project due to their inherent scalability and adaptability. The bot performs various database operations using the NoSQL database, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data as required for its functionalities. The NoSQL database used in this project also ensures data security with its built-in security features, such as access controls, encryption, and backups for data protection. Please replace this template information with specifics about the NoSQL database you are using in your project, such as the type of NoSQL database (Document, Key-Value, Column, Graph), the specific NoSQL database system (MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, etc.), and how it is used in your project.

### Automated Tests
This project uses automated tests to ensure the security of the web server. These tests are written using the `pytest` and `requests` libraries and check the following aspects:

- Enabling of the modern and secure TLSv1.2 protocol (`test_tlsv1_2_enabled`)

The tests are located in the `tests/test_security.py` file.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
pytest bot/tests/HttpSecurityTests.py
```

user@computername watcher_bot % helm upgrade \
  --atomic \
  --cleanup-on-fail \
  --install watcher-bot ./Chart \
  -f Chart/values.yaml \
  --namespace default \
  --wait --timeout 300

```
* Look at your kubernetes cluster:
```sh
user@computername watcher_bot % kubectl get pods

NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

(user@computername watcher_bot % kubectl logs watcher-bot-python-54cd7cb78b-nztbw
2024-03-13 19:24:54,779 - INFO - [System] Bot started!
2024-03-13 19:24:54,986 - INFO - [System] Sending message to <your_telegram_id>: [System] Daemon Started on External IP: <your_external_ip>
```

## Run without Daemon mode (information about deployment)
Example commands:
```sh
# DO NOT FORGET ABOUT ENV VARIABLES
# TOKEN=<type_your_token> ALLOWED_USERS=<type_admins_id>

python3 ./bot/SimpleMessage.py infoDeploySuccess --text "Deployment was successful"
python3 ./bot/SimpleMessage.py infoDeployFail --text "Deployment failed"
python3 ./bot/SimpleMessage.py sendFileToUser --path "<path>"
```

### Capabilities

- **Command Line Arguments**: The script accepts command line arguments to specify the command to execute (`infoDeploySuccess` or `infoDeployFail`), the ID of the admin chat, and the text to send.

- **Deployment Status Messages**: The script can send two types of deployment status messages: `infoDeploySuccess` and `infoDeployFail`. These messages can be customized with the `--text` command line argument.

- **Environment Variable Substitution**: The script supports environment variable substitution in the text messages. This allows you to include dynamic information in your messages. For example, you can include the deployment stage, project name, version, and error message in your deployment status messages.

- **Error Handling**: The script includes error handling to ensure that it fails gracefully if an error occurs. For example, it checks that the Telegram bot token and allowed users are set, and it catches exceptions when sending messages.

To use the script, you can run it from the command line with the appropriate arguments. For example:

```sh
python3 ./bot/SimpleMessage.py infoDeploySuccess --adminChat $ALLOWED_USERS --text "Deployment was successful"
```
This will send a message to the specified admin chat indicating that the deployment was successful. Please replace the command and text with the actual command and message you want to send.

## Deploy to the cloud (pythonanywhere.com)
Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy your project on PythonAnywhere:

1. **Create an account on PythonAnywhere**: If you don't have an account yet, go to [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) and sign up for a new account.

2. **Open the PythonAnywhere dashboard**: After logging in, you'll be taken to your dashboard. Click on the "Web" tab.

3. **Add a new web app**: Click on the "Add a new web app" button. Follow the steps in the wizard. When asked for the Python version, choose the one that matches your project.

4. **Configure the WSGI file**: PythonAnywhere uses the WSGI standard for Python web apps. You'll need to edit the WSGI configuration file to point PythonAnywhere at your web app. The path to this file is displayed on the "Web" tab. It's usually in the format `/var/www/your_username_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py`.

5. **Upload your code**: You can upload your code to PythonAnywhere using Git. First, install Git on PythonAnywhere using the "Bash" console with the command `git clone https://github.com/q163i/watcher_bot.git`. Then, navigate to the directory where you want to put your code, and clone your repository.

6. **Install dependencies**: If your project has any dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file, you can install them using pip. Open a Bash console, navigate to your project's directory, and run `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`.

7. **Reload your web app**: After you've uploaded your code and installed your dependencies, go back to the "Web" tab and hit the "Reload" button. PythonAnywhere will restart your web app with the new code.

8. **Check your site**: You should now be able to visit your username.pythonanywhere.com and see your web app live!

Remember to replace `your_username` with your actual PythonAnywhere username and `https://github.com/q163i/watcher_bot.git` with the actual URL of your Git repository.
